DisjointSets-CPP
================

This file provides a basic disjoint-sets data structure (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) in C++. It includes weighted union and path compression features, thus has a running-time on M union-find operations on N objects in O(N + Mlog*(N)) time.

This is my first public contribution to GitHub! Comments on my implementation are very welcome. I still have much to learn in programming.
